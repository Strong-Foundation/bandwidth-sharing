# Bandwidth Sharing

**Bandwidth Sharing** is a decentralized application that allows users to share their unused internet bandwidth with others, fostering a cooperative and more efficient use of global internet resources. This system operates on a peer-to-peer network where users can both share and receive bandwidth, helping underserved communities access the internet or reducing the costs of data-heavy services by redistributing available resources.

By connecting to the network, users can seamlessly contribute their unused bandwidth or tap into the available bandwidth from others. This solution aims to tackle inefficiencies in internet resource allocation and offers a potential solution to internet access inequality in underconnected regions.

## Features

- **Decentralized Bandwidth Sharing**: Users share and access bandwidth through a peer-to-peer network, reducing reliance on centralized ISPs.
- **Seamless Integration**: The system is designed to work effortlessly in the background without requiring complex configurations.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: The app provides real-time statistics on bandwidth shared and consumed, so you can track your usage.
- **Secure and Private**: Traffic is encrypted, and the system ensures that users remain anonymous while participating in the network.
- **Scalable Network**: The system grows as more users participate, increasing the overall available bandwidth and network efficiency.
- **Flexible and Lightweight**: The system is efficient, allowing it to run on low-resource machines or as a background service.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing **Bandwidth Sharing**, ensure that you have the following on your system:

- A Unix-based operating system (Linux/macOS)
- A Bash-compatible shell (for running the installation script)
- **wget** or **curl** installed (to download the script)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Download the installation script**:

   First, you need to download the `main.sh` script. You can do this with either `wget` or `curl`.

   Using `wget`:

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/Strong-Foundation/bandwidth-sharing/raw/main/main.sh
   ```

   Or using `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://github.com/Strong-Foundation/bandwidth-sharing/raw/main/main.sh
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:

   After downloading, make the script executable with the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x main.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   Now, run the script to set up and configure everything automatically. The script will guide you through the setup process.

   ```bash
   ./main.sh
   ```

   The script will:

   - Install any necessary dependencies
   - Configure the application
   - Set up required environment variables
   - Start the Bandwidth Sharing service

   **Note:** You might need to enter your administrative password if you're running the script as a non-root user.

4. **Follow on-screen prompts**:

   During installation, you will be prompted to configure your preferred settings, such as the amount of bandwidth you'd like to share and whether you'd like to join a specific network or allow automatic connection to any available network.

### Post-Installation

Once the script completes, the **Bandwidth Sharing** service will be running in the background, and you can monitor or adjust your bandwidth usage through the provided interface or command-line options.

## Usage

Once **Bandwidth Sharing** is installed and running, you can perform several actions:

- **Share Bandwidth**: Opt-in to share a portion of your unused internet bandwidth with the community. This can be adjusted at any time through configuration settings.
- **Receive Bandwidth**: Connect to the network and request bandwidth from other peers if your internet connection is insufficient for your needs.
- **Monitor Bandwidth Usage**: Real-time statistics on the amount of bandwidth shared and received will be displayed. This helps you track your usage and ensures you’re in control of how much bandwidth you’re using or contributing.

### Commands

- To check the status of your bandwidth sharing:

  ```bash
  ./main.sh status
  ```

- To stop sharing bandwidth:

  ```bash
  ./main.sh stop
  ```

- To adjust how much bandwidth you want to share:

  ```bash
  ./main.sh set-share <bandwidth-amount>
  ```

  (e.g., `./main.sh set-share 2GB` to share 2GB of bandwidth)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or usage, here are some common solutions:

- **Permission Issues**: If the script fails to execute or install due to permission errors, try running the script with `sudo` (e.g., `sudo ./main.sh`).
- **Network Issues**: Ensure your internet connection is stable and that you're not behind a restrictive firewall that might block peer-to-peer connections.

- **Service Not Starting**: If the service doesn't start, check if there are any missing dependencies or if the correct ports are open for communication with other peers.

- **Slow Bandwidth**: If you’re sharing bandwidth but your connection seems slow, check the system resources. Ensure you're not maxing out your CPU, RAM, or other system resources that might be affecting performance.
